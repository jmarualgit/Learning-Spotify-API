# Learning-Spotify-API
Folowed a YouTube tutorial from Akamai Developer and eventually branched off and explored. 

Created my app starting through the Spotify Dashboard, got my tokens there, and set up my project accordingly with the YT tutorial.

Will use this as a baseline in a hackathon currently participating in with 3 other members to design a Spotify app.
